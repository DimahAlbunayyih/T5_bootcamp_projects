Introduction:
In this project, I will do web scraping for a Real estate data in Saudi Arabia and do a regression model to predict estate prices. Also, I will do exploratory data analysis for the data.

Backstory:
He has a real estate office and he wants me to predict the prices of houses and apartments in Saudi Arabia.

Dataset:
In this project, I will do web scraping for a Real estate data from this website https://www.bayut.sa/ 

Algorithms:
After I scraped data, I will do data cleaning, pre-processing and delete the duplicate records and check if there are any null values then drop them. After that I will do analysis and linear regression.
Tools:
I will use kaggle, Excel, sqlalchemy, Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting, sklearn Linear Regression and RidgeCV.


Conclusion:
At the end, I will predict the estate prices in Saudi Arabia
